### Upgrades to make to the app

*Eliza's going to work on designing the UI. Once that's done we can start implementing it*

**I need to figure out a hosting platform so that we can host this and other sites

## Styling things to fix:

- Create an "all" option in the category dropdown to refetch all the products
  - I think we can do this by creating an "all products" option in the categories list
- Make first letter of categories capitalized


## Features to add:

- Add searchbar above sorting bar
- Add help button to the top


## Reference pages to use

- Make this similar to Nike's new arrivals section - https://www.nike.com/w/new-mens-3n82yznik1



## How to get project started

- Node server: node server.js
- Angular startup script: ng serve
- Stripe checkout: enter email, enter 4242424242 for credit card
- To see payments in stripe developer console: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/payments
