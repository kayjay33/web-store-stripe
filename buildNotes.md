### Upgrades to make to the app

**I need to figure out a hosting platform so that we can host this and other sites

## Styling things to fix:

- Create an "all" option in the category dropdown to refetch all the products
  - I think we can do this by creating an "all products" option in the categories list
- Make first letter of categories capitalized


**Eliza Changes**

- Need to change the colors and add a gradient to the home page
- Need to change the orientation of the categories
- Need to add an option to "view" an item when clicked, then have a "items you may also like"
- Need to change the checkout styling to the "price tag" look that Eliza made
- Need to add the new logo


## Features to add:

- Add searchbar above sorting bar
- Add help button to the top
- Need to make sure all API keys are protected


## Reference pages to use

- Make this similar to Nike's new arrivals section - https://www.nike.com/w/new-mens-3n82yznik1
